1. Read data from airflow sensors
2. Uses 12VDC input
3. Has a TFT screen to display sensor values and UI elements to control the motors.
4. LDO voltage regulator MIC2940A to convert 12VDC to 3.3VDC
5. TMUX1208PWR multiplexer for data and clock signals
6. Pressure sensor that measures static pressure and the data is available on the display
